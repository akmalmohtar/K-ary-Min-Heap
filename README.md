# D-ary-Min-Heap
A d-ary heap is like a binary heap but non-leaf nodes have d children instead of 2 children. One exception is allowed, namely, one node can have less than d children. Recall that a min-heap is like a max-heap, but it has to support removing the minimum value instead of the maximum. In this assignment, you are asked to implement a d-ary min-heap.   Input: The first line will contain two space-delimited integers d and c. d is the number of children per node in the heap and c is the number of commands that follow. The next c lines constitute commands that will be given to the heap. For this problem, there are three valid commands: add, remove, and print. Lines for addition will contain the command "add" followed by an integer n, where n is the number that needs to be added to the heap. Lines for removal will have the string "remove", and the minimum value will be removed from the heap. Lines for printing will contain the string "print".  Output Each time a remove is requested, print out the integer removed on its own line. Each time a print line is requested, the user is expected to output a line of p space-delimited integers in the order of the array representation of the heap.
